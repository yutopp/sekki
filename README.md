# âš’ Sekki toolchains

The repository `Sekki toolchains` include my hobby toolchain programs that are *under development*, like an assembler, a linker, a compiler, and a runtime library.

Now, supported platforms are only Linux on x86_64.

## Requirement

Only [nasm](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netwide_Assembler) is required to build an initial assembler. After that, any toolchain not included in this repository will not be required.

## Toolchains

- [x] [stone](./stone)
  - `stone` is an initial assembler, and able to self-hosting!
